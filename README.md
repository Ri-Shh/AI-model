AI Model Explorer provides an integrated platform to browse through various AI models created by its users, allowing them to develop ModelCards for their own models as well. The Explorer is engrained with login/ logout facility which enables them to visit their own profile, where one can view the models they posted and queries from the discussion forum. The web app also accredits the user to like the available models, which in turn are shown in the ‘Spotlight’ section of the homepage. The homepage also features a ‘Try it Out’ section where the users can get hands-on experience of an AI Model- ‘Text-to-Speech’ generator.
